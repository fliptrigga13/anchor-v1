"""ANCHOR v1 — non-bypassable PEP deployment reference (Wave 2, Revision B pivot 11; blocker 6).

DEPLOYMENT INVARIANT (architectural, not advisory):
--------------------------------------------------
The Policy Enforcement Point runs OUTSIDE the agent sandbox boundary and holds
the downstream credentials. The agent process never sees them. An agent that
holds ambient AWS keys (or any ambient credential) plus a governor *library*
is UNGOVERNED — a library cannot stop code that simply doesn't call it, and
ambient credentials let the agent reach past any in-process check.

This module is the reference shape of that deployment:

* ``CredentialBroker`` holds the raw downstream secrets (secret env vars,
  bearer tokens). It exposes ONLY brokered execution: the PEP may inject
  secrets into a child process environment or into egress headers, but
  ``broker.secrets`` raises ``BrokerAccessDenied`` — agent-side code cannot
  read the raw values through any public attribute.
* ``ShellPEP.execute`` consumes the capability atomically FIRST (via the
  store's linearizable transaction) and only then spawns the subprocess,
  with brokered env injected by the PEP into the child process env. Any
  failure — bad capability, double-spend, holder mismatch, digest mismatch,
  unknown command — raises BEFORE the subprocess starts, so nothing
  executes without authorization.
* ``EgressProxy.authorize_http`` consumes the capability atomically FIRST
  and returns brokered headers for the EXACT action digest; any other digest
  is refused.

Tests assert the invariant directly: calling ``subprocess`` without going
through the PEP never reaches the broker, and ``broker.secrets`` is
unreadable from the caller side.
