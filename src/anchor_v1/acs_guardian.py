"""ANCHOR v1 — ACS Guardian (Wave 0, blocker 4).

The hardened OWASP ACS Guardian: an external authority that intercepts agent
lifecycle events over the wire and answers allow/deny/modify/ask/defer.

Where the reference ACS Guardian is weak (no wire auth, fail-open default,
2/19 hooks live), this one is:

  * **Wire-authenticated** — every frame is HMAC-signed under a pre-shared
    key with a fresh nonce and a timestamp window (replay protection).
  * **Fail-closed** — guardian error, decision-function exception, decision
    timeout, malformed frame, bad HMAC, stale timestamp, unknown event type,
    or an event on a disabled hook ALL produce DENY. There is no fail-open
    path in this module; the test suite asserts that property behaviorally.
  * **Full hook coverage** — all 19 OWASP ACS lifecycle hooks are live and
    explicit (Phase I: ingestion & planning, Phase II: action & tool
    proposal, Phase III: execution & enforcement, Phase IV: delegation,
    memory & egress); disabled hooks are not silently skipped. The 9 original
    Anchor hooks are retained as canonical aliases of their OWASP
    counterparts (e.g. ``pre_tool_call`` ≡ ``on_tool_call_proposed``).

One authority primitive: **every ALLOW mints a one-use holder-of-key
capability** via ``authority.issue_execution``, bound to the
``action_digest`` of a canonical ``ActionEnvelope`` built from the event
(``plane="acs"``, ``verb=event.action``, ``target=event.resource``,
``args_digest=sha256(canonical(params))``). The capability is a COSE_Sign1
object bound to the subject's registered holder public key — presenting the
COSE bytes alone is never enough; the holder must also prove possession of
the holder key per request. There are no two execution paths
(easy→direct, hard→capability): the capability IS the authorization. An
ALLOW decision without a minted capability is impossible by construction —
the mint step failing turns the decision into DENY.

Holder keys are an out-of-band registry (``holder_keys`` constructor arg,
subject → 32-byte Ed25519 public key; the SPIFFE/OIDC adapters in Wave 5
will feed this). An unknown subject or a malformed holder key makes the
mint raise, which becomes DENY: fail closed, no bearer fallback.

Wire protocol (testable stand-in):
  * Frame: ``b"ACS1"`` magic + 4-byte big-endian body length + JSON body.
  * Body: ``{"v":1, "kind":"event"|"decision", "nonce":hex, "ts":iso8601,
    "payload":{...}, "hmac":hex}``.
  * ``hmac`` = HMAC-SHA256(psk, canonical_bytes({v,kind,nonce,ts,payload})).
  * Nonces are single-use per guardian (replays are DENY); timestamps must
    fall inside ``replay_window_s`` of the guardian clock.

  **Production note:** this HMAC-PSK wire auth is the testable stand-in for a
  mutually-authenticated channel. In production the transport MUST be mTLS
  (or a DPoP-bound channel) with the same nonce/timestamp replay discipline
  on top. The PSK here must never be a long-lived production credential.

Local only. No network calls. The ``WirePeer`` class is the test harness that
speaks the same bytes so tests exercise real framing/auth, not in-process
shortcuts.

      the envelope to the execution plane, and the PEP's digest->command
