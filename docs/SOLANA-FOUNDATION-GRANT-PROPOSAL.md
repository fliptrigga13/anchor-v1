## 1. Executive Summary & Problem Statement

Autonomous AI agents executing on Solana (powered by frameworks such as Solana Agent Kit, ElizaOS, Rig, and LangChain) represent the fastest-growing frontier of decentralized automation. However, current agent deployment patterns suffer from a fatal security vulnerability: **Ambient Authority and Key Compromise**.

### The Vulnerability:
1. **Raw Signing Keys in Agent Context:** Agents are provisioned with raw Ed25519 private keys or unrestricted ambient RPC signing capabilities.
2. **Prompt Injection & Model Drift Exploitation:** If an LLM agent experiences prompt injection, tool-call hallucination, or adversarial jailbreaking, the agent can immediately broadcast arbitrary transactions: draining treasuries, transferring assets to attacker-controlled accounts, or calling malicious smart contracts.
3. **Absence of Cryptographic Policy Binding:** Transactions submitted by AI agents carry no tamper-proof cryptographic audit trail proving which governance policy, budget cap, or human quorum authorized the action.

## 2. The Solution: ANCHOR v1 Constitutional Runtime

**ANCHOR v1** introduces a formally modeled (TLA+ verified), fail-closed constitutional runtime designed specifically to secure autonomous AI agents on Solana.

### Key Architectural Invariants:
1. **Zero Ambient Authority (`SolanaCredentialBroker`):**
   * Private signing keys are strictly isolated in a tamper-resistant broker outside the agent execution boundary.
   * Direct inspection of private keys or secrets by agent code triggers immediate `BrokerAccessDenied` exceptions.
2. **Cryptographic Capability Envelopes (COSE-Sign1):**
   * Agents cannot broadcast transactions at will. They must propose an `ActionEnvelope` and obtain an unforgeable COSE-Sign1 capability token attested by an Ed25519 constitutional quorum.
3. **Fail-Closed Policy Enforcement Point (`SolanaInstructionPEP`):**
   * Intercepts every Solana instruction prior to serialization and signing.
   * Enforces program ID whitelisting (System Program, SPL Token, Token-2022, Compute Budget, etc.).
   * Enforces recipient address whitelisting and transaction lamport spend ceilings.
4. **Linearizable Single-Use Store (`CapabilityStore`):**
   * Every capability is atomically consumed in a linearizable store, guaranteeing mathematical immunity against double-spends, replay attacks, and TOCTOU divergence.
5. **SCITT Immutable Audit Attestation:**
   * Emits deterministic SCITT (Supply Chain Integrity, Transparency, and Trust) audit receipts linking action digests, on-chain transaction signatures, and constitutional policy references.

## 4. Public Good Impact on the Solana Ecosystem

ANCHOR v1 is 100% open-source software built to protect the Solana ecosystem:
* **Securing Autonomous Capital:** Enables DAOs, enterprise treasuries, and DeFi protocols to deploy autonomous agents with mathematical assurance that wallets cannot be drained beyond predefined spend envelopes.
* **Ecosystem Standardization:** Establishes the first formal, RFC-compliant cryptographic capability and policy enforcement standard for Solana AI agent frameworks.
* **Attracting Institutional Liquidity:** Provides institutional risk managers and compliance officers with verifiable audit receipts required to fund autonomous on-chain trading and governance strategies.

## 5. Verification & Test Receipts

ANCHOR v1 features a comprehensive, battle-tested test suite:

```bash
# Run the complete Anchor v1 integration test suite
pytest -v tests/test_solana_pep.py tests/test_jupiter_pep.py
```

### Verified Test Matrix:
* `test_credential_broker_isolation`: PASS (Zero ambient access to private keys)
* `test_successful_solana_transfer_execution`: PASS (500M lamport transfer with SCITT receipt)
* `test_double_spend_replay_rejected`: PASS (Atomic fail-closed replay containment)
* `test_unauthorized_program_id_rejected_before_consumption`: PASS (Rogue program ID rejection)
* `test_unauthorized_recipient_rejected_before_consumption`: PASS (Rogue recipient address rejection)
* `test_budget_exceeded_rejected`: PASS (Transaction ceiling enforcement)
* `test_multi_instruction_transaction_success`: PASS (Atomic multi-instruction batching)
* `test_invalid_plane_rejected`: PASS (Plane isolation enforcement)
